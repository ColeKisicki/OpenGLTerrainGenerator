# OpenGLTerrainGenerator

- Currently this program uses the marching cubes algorithm and 3D perlin noise to make an interesting 3D object. WARNING the object currently flashes with different colors each update.
- As of now the Marching cubes algorithm works (aside from normal calculations for lighting)
- All I need to do now to finish up my project is to finish up the normal calculations for the marching cubes algorithm and to use some simple noise to create a landscape then add a texture to it.
- The camera angle is strange at the moment but I plan to fix that within the next day or so. Use the arrow keys to look around at the generated geometry.
